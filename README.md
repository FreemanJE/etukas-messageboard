This assignment combines both frontend and backend, but with a focus on the backend

This is a fullstack application which serves as an online messageboard. Features of this application include a full REST API, with user data stored in a MongoDB server. Users should be able to register, login, view, create, update and delete posts.



## Folder structure

There are 2 folders:

1. `/client` - this contains the `create-react-app` built React frontend
    - This will run on port `3000`

2. `/server` - this contains the backend code
    - This will run on port `3001`

### Backend

The backend is stored in the `/server` folder

 REST API are created to serve the frontend

This REST API will do the following:

- allow users to view all posts
- allow users to view a single post
- allow users to register
- allow users to login
- allow users to create a new post
- allow users to edit a their previous posts
- allow users to delete previous posts

All users will be allowed to post content, but users can only modify or delete posts which they have created

The REST API will use authentication and authorisation to validate users. You will be expected to implement this.

#### Backend Tasks

The backend 

### Frontend

For the frontend is a simple uncomplicated well structured application created with React. Feel free to try and recommend

Have fun!
